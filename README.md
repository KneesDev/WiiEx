## Installation

You can install WiiEx using **a WAD file which can be downloaded from the link below**.

If you want to **install WiiEx in a real console**, then you'll need to **do some weird homebrew stuff**.

However, the process will be much easier by **installation in an emulator** like [Dolphin](https://dolphin-emu.org/download/).

## Download Link

You can [click here](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1rexKFyYjkMLGm4rFl4MQ7L0S5BmsQvyL) to download the **latest WiiEx WAD file**.
